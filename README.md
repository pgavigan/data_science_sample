# data_science_sample

This is a very simple example of a typical data science workflow. It has three main steps:

1) Download data from some online source.
2) Organize the data that was downloaded and store it in a database of some sort.
3) Query the database and perform some analysis on the data.

Although the example here is very simple, it is meant to be a guide for making other, more interesting, data science projects.
